FenceMaster
===========

An exercise in artificial intelligence and machine learning for a third year university subject.

This project is an attempt to create an AI that can compete and win against a human player in a game of FenceMaster. 
The FenceMaster game is based on a hexagonal board and is played in turns, which consist of each player placing a black/white
piece on the board. A player wins when they create a group of pieces that either connect three sides of the board (corners
not included) or form a loop around at least one empty tile.

The FenceMaster AI is intended to be able to play and compute solutions on a board of any size.
